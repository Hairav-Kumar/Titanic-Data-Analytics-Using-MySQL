# Titanic-Data-Analytics-Using-MySQL

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger demographics, survival rates, and influential factors in passenger survival. Using MySQL, I conducted in-depth data exploration and ran queries to answer various analytical questions, focusing on identifying trends, relationships, and patterns within the data.

Key Objectives:
Survival Analysis: Determined survival rates based on gender, age groups, class, and embarkation points.
Demographic Breakdown: Analyzed passenger distribution by age, gender, and socioeconomic status (ticket class).
Family Composition: Examined family size and its impact on survival.
Fare Insights: Investigated ticket fare distributions across classes and their correlation with survival chances.
Class Comparison: Compared survival outcomes and demographic distributions across passenger classes.

Skills and Tools:
SQL Techniques: Used filtering, grouping, joins, aggregate functions, and subqueries for data analysis.
Database Management: Efficiently handled and queried a large dataset in MySQL.
Data Insights: Extracted insights to understand the survival patterns and demographic effects on survival rates.

Findings:
This analysis revealed critical insights, such as higher survival rates among women and children, the importance of passenger class in survival, and fare variations by embarkation point.
